# not equals to             !=
# less than                  <
# greater than               >
# less than and equals to    <=
#greater than and equals to  >=

# question : is 4 equals to 4?
# print(4==4)
# print(4!=4)
# print(4>3)
# print(4<3)
# print(1>=2)
# print(5<=9)


# application of logical operators
sami_age=4
age_at_school=5
print(sami_age==age_at_school)
